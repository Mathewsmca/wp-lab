<h2>
<p>If there’s one key takeaway of the day with the new Gurkha, it’s that it’s not a one trick pony like its predecessor was.
That is, great off-road but compromised in every other respect. The Gurkha has become more practical, friendlier and cooler even,
and has evolved to the extent that it can be thought as your only vehicle. Make no mistake though because the Gurkha is still no softie.
It’s very much a hardcore off-roader first whose natural habitat is the real jungle and not the urban jungle.
Those looking for the latest of gizmos and car-like comfort need not apply. </p></h2>
